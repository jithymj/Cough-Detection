# Cough Detection using Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting cough events from audio data using deep learning models. Two main approaches were explored: a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST). The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation pipelines.

How to Run
step 1: Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Cough-Detection.git
cd Cough-Detection
step 2: Preprocess the data
Open and run DataPreprocessing.ipynb to extract and format features.
step 3: Train models
Run 1D_CNN_Model.py to train a CNN model.
or open AST.ipynb to run the transformer-based model.
